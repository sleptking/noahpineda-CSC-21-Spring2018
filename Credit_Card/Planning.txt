Psuedo Code:
    1. Recieve input from a text file with card numbers on it.
    2. Check validity by putting the number through Luhn Algorithm.
    3. Compare the card number to the prefixes and lengths provided to determine the card type.
    4. If no card type tell the user "unknown card type"
    5. Output the card type and the card number.
